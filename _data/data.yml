    summary: |
      Hi! My name is Florian Blume and I am a fourth-year PhD student at Technical University of Berlin in Olaf Hellwich's computer vision lab. My research is focused on better alining human perception and synthetic processing in the case of facial expression recognition. We perceive in context and draw on prior knowledge that we have acquired but artificial systems largely do not. In my PhD, I lay the foundation for a research path that focuses on bridging this gap. I am currently writing up my thesis, if you are interested in my research or have job opportunities, hit me up!
